JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
JavaScript.com is a resource built by the Pluralsight team for the JavaScript community.

Because JavaScript is a great language for coding beginners, we've gathered some of the best learning resources around and built a JavaScript course to help new developers get up and running.

With the help of community members contributing content to the site, JavaScript.com aims to also keep more advanced developers up to date on news, frameworks, and libraries.
